      <h1>CMS Alternative</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Date: <span class="post-meta">Dec 07, 2022</span></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        CMS (Content Management System) is the software that is powering the
        internet world. It is a system that helps a common person create, modify
        and manage the content of a blog or a website without any technical
        know-how. They are growing and so is their eco-system, and over the past
        few years, I have spent thousands in this open-source cobweb.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Content Management System is a great tool for people who don't have
        the appetite and ability to learn a new skill. It is also true that
        people are so busy with their work that they actually don't have time to
        learn the basics.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also true that if you want to host a piece of content online you
        don't need JavaScript or a MySQL database, you just need HTML. If I have
        to create a web page that says <b>Hello World!!</b> I don't need CMS
        software to do that, I just have to use an H or P tag inside the body
        element of an HTML page and it will display the same. Now, the page that
        comes out of CMS is eye-appealing, people like that no problem let's add
        CSS to the mix, and you will get a better-looking page.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are plenty of reasons why people want to shift from one CMS to
        another but I don't want to shift from one web to another. I would
        suggest people who are looking for CMS alternative to dive deep if they
        don't have the time and are ready for the effort then hire a person who
        will do it for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        People will spend thousands of their hard-earned money on a plugin that
        does nothing but adds a meta tag in the head section. This is how the
        system works, you pick a base which is open source, then just to add or
        remove the functionality in the base software you buy an addon, but the
        same thing you can do it manually.
      </p>
      <h2>What is a CMS Alternative?</h2>
      <p>
        There is <b>only one good alternative</b> to CMS that will depend on
        your needs, personal or business. If it's for business hire a technical
        person who will do it for you. If it is for a personal project then get
        your hands dirty. There are plenty of courses that you can check if you
        want it free then
        <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >YouTube</a
        >
        has so much content that teaches you the ABC of HTML and CSS that you
        can drop CMS and work without it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site where you are reading this, if you have reached here, is based
        on simple HTML and CSS. I am not an expert I just know the basics, once
        the structure is ready I just copy-paste the content from my word
        document to the HTML page. If a person like me can do it in 10 days I am
        sure you can do it in 5.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever you shift from one CMS to another or from CMS to No-CMS there
        are going to be positives and there are going to be negatives, so let's
        discuss them and bring them into the picture.
      </p>
      <h2>Advantages of No-CMS</h2>

      <h3>Skill</h3>
      <p>
        This is one of the biggest advantages of going self-develop way. An
        additional skill, that will make anyone stand out from the crowd. Just
        by learning HTML and CSS, you are above the knowledge chain.
      </p>
      <h3>Control</h3>
      <p>
        Another advantage of No-CMS is the control over the content and also how
        it is displayed. The Owner will decide which meta tags should be used,
        and which script to run on which page. There is 100% control when you
        self-develop.
      </p>
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        One big advantage is security, when the creator knows every line of
        code, one can immediately spot an alien code if any. It is easy to
        safeguard things which one knows inside out.
      </p>
      <h3>Customization</h3>
      <p>
        The depth of customization that can be done on a self-developed site can
        not be matched with the packaged CMS.
      </p>
      <h3>Cost</h3>
      <p>
        I have personally spent money on yearly subscription plugins that now I
        feel were a waste, I could have got my hands dirty and done it myself.
      </p>
      <h3>Attention to detail</h3>
      <p>
        I never gave attention to small things like meta tags or H1 or header
        tags which are so important in terms of not just SEO but also page
        optimization. Now that I am doing all the heavy lifting in the back end,
        I spend an extra 30 min on these small details.
      </p>
      <h2>Disadvantages of No-CMS</h2>

      <h3>Learning Curve</h3>
      <p>
        There is a learning curve to No-CMS, a person with no knowledge can not
        start a site from day one. One has to get down to basics and move
        upwards.
      </p>
      <h3>Time-consuming</h3>
      <p>
        The CMS alternative way is time-consuming, if it takes 2 minutes to post
        a blog on CMS it will take 30 to 40 min on the No-CMS. CMS comes as a
        package so when I customize one page that affects all the pages
        instantly but in No-CMS every page needs to be revisited.
      </p>
      <h3>Effort</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to CMS a person only puts his or her effort into
        generating the content, but when it comes to self-develop it is the
        content as well as the back end structure.
      </p>
      <h3>Community Effect</h3>
      <p>
        When you are using a CMS or a plugin there is a huge community that is
        also using the same so the help is just typing away, but when you code
        and do it yourself you rely on your own search, learning and
        understanding.
      </p>
      <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        CMS are a great tool for online communities, but they are also like a
        cobweb, somehow a person will end up paying some cost. I have learned a
        lot in the past years my main learning was the money I spent, I could
        have put that same amount into running ads that would give my site more
        visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want an alternative to CMS the only way is to self-learn and
        develop, going from one CMS to another is like holding an ear, over the
        head or around the head. So, please look at the real alternative
        solution don't go from one ecosystem to another eco-system. Ultimately
        you are still stuck. Give the alternative that I have discussed above a
        try and I assure you, It will work, it may take time but you will be
        satisfied.
      </p>
