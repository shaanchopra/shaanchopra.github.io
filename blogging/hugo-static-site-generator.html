        Hugo is a static site generator which is on the rise and is used by a
        lot of high-traffic websites. The best part is it is open-source and
        requires minimal resources to put your site online. With Hugo, you can
        generate a blog or one page about me or a company website or a portfolio
        site anything you want. Sites generated are lite, fast, and responsive
        and give you a lot of control over the website.
      </p>
      <h2>What is Hugo?</h2>
      <p>
        A static site builder that uses
        <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Markdown</b> to create beautiful web pages.
        Hugo is based on the language GO and the first release was in 2013. On
        the
        <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >official site</a
        >, it claims that it is the world's fastest framework for building
        websites.

          Hugo currently has a market share of .02% and does very well with
          high-traffic.

      <h2>How is it different?</h2>
      <p>
        Hugo generates static pages, there is no database or PHP attached to
        them which makes it super <b>lite and fast</b>. When you upload the
        files to the web server their size is usually in single digit MB.
        Whereas the most popular CMS WordPress is about 20 MB.
      </p>
      <p>
        The base file that generates the pages is always with you and is not
        uploaded which makes it ways safer. In addition to this when there is no
        database there is no worry of a data leak.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flexibility in customisation is unmatched, provided you should have the
        basics of coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Hugo forget about updating applications, plugins, databases and
        backend services on regular bases. It is one of the easiest way to
        <a
          href="../technology/why-is-the-self-hosted-and-self-developed-site-so-important.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >
          develop</a
        >
        and manage content of a website.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Advantages of HUGO</h2>

      <h3>Speed</h3>
      <p>
        Static pages are lite and serve fast online. I personally have used Hugo
        for a personal project and the time for the page load is really less.
        This primarily happens because servers don't have to work overtime in
        finding the data requested at different locations. All the data to
        render the request is at the page level.
      </p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        When there is no database then there is no motivation for hackers and
        bad elements to hack. The base file is not required to be uploaded on
        the server which means the base will remain with you safely. Modern cms
        require passwords to log in at the backend to create content, but on
        Hugo, you don't require passwords. You generate and modify pages locally
        and upload just the serveable file.
      </p>
      <h3>Simplicity</h3>
      <p>
        Hugo site builder is simple, but it does require a bit of understanding,
        and once you get the hang of it, works really well. Anyone can start
        with a new Hugo site with just 3 words “<b>HUGO new site *_ _ _*</b>” on
        the command line. To do this you have to set up the Hugo environment
        which is also very simple.
      </p>
      <h2>How to start Hugo?</h2>
      <p>
        There are overwhelming ways of installing Hugo but I am going to tell
        you the easiest ways. The prerequisite software is VS Code or Atom where
        we are going to create the pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Step #1</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Download the
        <a
          href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >
          prebuilt binary</a
        >
        from GitHub. Unzip the file and copy the folder where you want to save
        your project. I created a folder named bin and placed all the files
        there.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center">
        <img
          style="width: 95%; max-width: 800px; height: auto"
          src="../images/folder-structure-for-hugo-binary.webp"
          alt="folder-structure-for-hugo-binary"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        <b>Step #2</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating the path to the binary. For this click the windows button and
        write “edit the system environment variable”, go to the Advance tab and
        click the environment variables.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center">
        <img
          style="width: 95%; max-width: 800px; height: auto"
          src="../images/setting-path-for-binary-part-1.webp"
          alt="setting-path-for-binary-part-1"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        Select Path and click edit and add a new path where you have saved the
        binary.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center">
        <img
          style="width: 95%; max-width: 800px; height: auto"
          src="../images/setting-path-for-binary-part-2.webp"
          alt="setting-path-for-binary-part-2"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        <b>Step #3</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        On the command line type “<b>hugo version</b>”, for accessing the
        command line just press (<b>Windows key+R</b>) and type CMD. This will
        give out which version you have on your system. With this your local
        machine, laptop or desktop is ready to create the first website.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Step #4</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        From the command line navigate to the place you want to place the site
        file. If you don't know how to use the command line. Then just open VS
        Code or Atom and open the folder where you placed the binary. Then from
        the top menu select Terminal and New Terminal.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center">
        <img
          style="width: 95%; max-width: 800px; height: auto"
          src="../images/vs-code-terminal.webp"
          alt="vs-code-terminal"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        <b>Step #5</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Type the command “<b>hugo new site SiteName</b>” (SiteName can be
        <i>whatever</i> you want) This will create a folder required for
        creating a static site. By default, there will be no content to view so
        you have to create content and that is easy.
      </p>

      <div style="text-align: center">
        <img
          style="width: 95%; max-width: 800px; height: auto"
          src="../images/cmd-start-new-site-in-hugo.webp"
          alt="cmd-for-starting-new-site-in-hugo"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        <b>Step #6</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        To create content on the command line type cd SiteName this will take
        you inside your site folder. Then type “<b
          >hugo new posts/first-post.md</b
        >” or create a new file with <b>.markdown or .md extension</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Step #7</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Add a theme to your site. Visit the
        <a
          href="https://themes.gohugo.io/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >
          HUGO theme</a
        >
        and select one, I am going with the default theme 'Ananke' by default
        the download button will lead you to the GitHub site where you would
        download all the files in a zip. Unzip all the files under the SiteName
        Theme section. (make sure the folder name is correct). Open the
        config.toml file and add “<b>theme = 'ananke'</b>”.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Step #7</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        To server or view the site or page type “<b>hugo server</b>”. This will
        host your site locally on (http://localhost:1313)
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Step #8</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you are done editing and creating your site to server the site on
        the server you have to type on the command line “hugo” this will build
        the static site file inside the public folder. Take these files and host
        the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Step #9</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever you want to edit the site, I usually delete all the files and
        folders inside the public folder and run the “hugo” command and upload
        the newly generated files.
      </p>

      <h3>Video for help</h3>
      <p>
        I found this video most helpful on the topic of getting started with
        HUGO

      <h2>Themes for HUGO</h2>
      <p>
        There are plenty of themes on the official site to select from. Do read
        the theme file while choosing, sometimes there is a different
        configuration for the config.toml file. All the themes are open-source
        and available on GitHub for download.
      </p>
      <h2>Where to Serve?</h2>
      <p>
        This is a static site generated from HUGO, you can host the file with
        any hosting provider. It can be shared, dedicated or even VPS. If you
        don't have a hosting solution then you can host the files on GitHub
        pages for free.
      </p>
      <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        I personally like what the HUGO website generator is able to do. The
        only drawback I see and what I feel is it's a bit technical. When we
        have to write a blog post in form of code/markdown. I need to know all
        those ways of editing. WordPress on the other hand makes it more
        user-friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        HUGO has the speed and is way more secure than WP, here is where the
        trade-off comes in place if you have 5 page static site then Hugo is the
        answer if you are looking for user-friendliness then turn towards WP. I
        would lastly say do try your hand at HUGO you might just like what it
        has to offer.
      </p>
