      <h1>Typography in Website Design</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Date: <span class="post-meta">Dec 03, 2022</span></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent five whole days fixing typography on this website, and this is
        one of the most underrated topics discussed in the internet world. Fonts
        on the website play a vital role, in how and where they are displayed is
        crucial for every site owner. We spend hours finding a suitable theme
        for our website but the least importance is given to the fonts that are
        being used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a good fast theme is important, but having well suitable fonts on
        the site is equally important. Themes will give your site a great look
        but fonts will increase user engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have seen so many websites that are using stock fonts which are not
        bad but that site can do really well if someone would work on the fonts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we start I must warn you that all the fonts that we see on the
        web are not free. Some of the most famous and used fonts like Helvetica,
        Bodoni, and Garamond are not under
        <a
          href="https://shaanchopra.net/blogging/what-is-gpl-gnu-general-public-license.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >GPL</a
        >. These fonts are expensive they charge websites for a number of views
        (pay-as-you-go).
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, you might find these fonts on the internet as free to download.
        That does not give you the license to apply them anywhere. There is
        nothing as personal use if any of these fonts are embedded in your CSS
        using @font-face. Then these font foundries can call for a copyright
        claim, I don't know the result but I do see Google removing sites from
        their search result.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are still a lot of fonts that are under the open-source license,
        try to use them first, and later if you feel comfortable then go buy a
        premium version.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Typography?</h2>
      <p>Typography is the way how your text is <b>displayed</b> to others.</p>
      <p>
        This can be on any form of print, from billboards to cell phones, on
        paper to digital devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just to give you an example you must have noticed when you are driving
        on the road there are these huge billboards. One can read them from far
        but when you get too close to them it becomes a bit difficult in reading
        them. This usually happens because of two main reasons one is our vision
        and the other is typography.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to typography there are so many details that go into this,
        starting from the type of <b>font</b>, <b>spacing</b>, <b>height</b>,
        <b>weight</b>, <b>size</b> and a <b>lot more</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a website owner, it is good to have a basic understanding of main
        font families.
      </p>
      <h3>Main Font-Family</h3>
      <p>
        There are four main types of font families that a website owner should
        know, Serif, Sans Serif, Display and Script.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll differentiate each one of them so that you can spot which type of
        family the font belongs to.
      </p>
      <h4>Serif</h4>
      <div style="text-align: center">
        <img
          style="width: 95%; max-width: 800px; height: auto"
          src="../images/font-family-serif.webp"
          alt="font-family-serif"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Fonts which are heavy on the feet and head and have extra strokes are
        serif fonts. When you look at these fonts you would feel like you are
        reading something old school. A lot of newspapers and print media use
        this type of font.
      </p>
      <h4>Sans Serif</h4>
      <div style="text-align: center">
        <img
          style="width: 95%; max-width: 800px; height: auto"
          src="../images/font-family-sans-serif.webp"
          alt="font-family-sans-serif"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Sans Serifs are similar to Serifs less the extra heaviness and strokes
        at the end. They look slim, and sleek, they are modern and are used by
        most websites for content.
      </p>
      <h4>Display</h4>
      <div style="text-align: center">
        <img
          style="width: 95%; max-width: 800px; height: auto"
          src="../images/font-family-display.webp"
          alt="font-family-display"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        These types of fonts are used for decoration display, they are big and
        heavy most of the huge billboards, flyers and other print media use this
        type of fonts. Some of the logos are made from this type of font.
      </p>
      <h4>Script</h4>
      <div style="text-align: center">
        <img
          style="width: 95%; max-width: 800px; height: auto"
          src="../images/font-family-script.webp"
          alt="font-family-script"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        These fonts are like a person's handwriting, they look really nice in
        some places. Just for example when you want to display your signature on
        the website this type of font family works really well.
      </p>
      <h3>Other Typographical Factors</h3>
      <p>
        There are a few factors that one should keep in mind as they play a big
        role when it comes to website content. These are <b>Bold</b>,
        <b>Italics</b>, <b>Size</b>, and <b>All-Caps</b> when applied to the
        content they speak to the readers.
      </p>
      <h4>Bold</h4>
      <p>
        Use this when you want to bring the reader's attention and when you want
        to emphasise a lot.
      </p>
      <h4>Italics</h4>
      <p>
        Italics are used when the level of emphasise is less than bold but also
        bring a decorative look to the running sentence.
      </p>
      <h4>All-Caps</h4>
      <p>
        This is another way of bringing the reader's attention but All-Caps
        should be avoided in a running sentence.
      </p>
      <div style="background-color: #26272c">
        <p style="color: white">
          Keep in mind the above three should only be used when required and
          also on just a few words. Using Bold and Italics on the whole sentence
          or paragraph will make the writer lose the ability to emphasise.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Size</h4>
      <p>
        The size of the fonts should be in line with the hierarchy of the
        content structure i.e H1, H2, and paragraphs.
      </p>
      <h2>Importance of Typography in Website</h2>
      <p>
        I must emphasise that the site owner should give time and notice the
        effects of typography.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me start by telling you that if you keep the font default then your
        site will display differently across operating systems and on different
        web browsers. Nobody wants that, the site experience should be uniform
        across different OS and browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you chose a font that is difficult to read or is too small or too
        large that counts as a bad user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a suitable good font with stable factors will be easy to read and
        lead to a good user experience. A good long user experience will have a
        positive effect on the page's SEO.
      </p>
      <h2>Typography and Websites</h2>
      <p>
        Now, please understand that there is no magic formula that a particular
        font will work on every site. The website owner has a ton of fonts and
        types at their disposal it is the work of the owner to apply and see
        what works best for the site.
      </p>
      <p>There are <b>certain guidelines</b> that one should follow:</p>
      <p>
        <b>1#</b> Try to keep font family and font type to a <b>minimum</b> as
        possible, changing fonts is not a good experience. At the most one can
        use <b>3 fonts</b>, one type of font for headings, one for content and
        the last for other decorative purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2#</b> All-Caps should be limited to <b>headings</b>. Writing
        All-Caps in content is difficult for users to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3#</b> <b>Sans Serif</b> fonts should be used for <b>content</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4#</b> <b>Size</b> matters and you should be testing the appropriate
        font size. The best way is to show different sizes to a few people and
        ask them which size they found the <b>easiest to read</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5#</b> <b>Spacing</b> between lines and characters should also be
        tested.
      </p>
      <h2>Where to Find Fonts?</h2>
      <p>
        There are these wonderful places that have plenty of fonts to choose
        from and even if you have to buy a font don't hesitate because it is a
        good one-time investment and fonts stay on the site for a very long
        time. It is one of those things that directly impact your user
        experience.

      <p>
        Now that you have a basic understanding of what typography and font
        family is it is time to apply them to the website.
      </p>
      <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

      <p>
        Typography in website design plays a very crucial role and everyone
        should pay more attention to this. Fonts on a website are such a small
        thing that it usually goes unnoticed but this small thing plays a huge
        role in user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I have just scratched the surface there is a lot that goes into
        deciding the font for your site. Before understanding the importance I
        also thought I will just use Helvetica for my site but that is not free.
        Also when you call a default font in your CSS that just means you want
        your site to be displayed with that font. If the person who is viewing
        the site has that font installed or the browser has that font the site
        will be displayed with that font.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even when you have a font embedded in your CSS the different browsers
        tend to show things differently, especially when it comes to colour. So,
        always try to view your own site in different browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe a beautifully designed site along with good typography
        complements each other. Which definitely will have a positive effect on
        the overall performance of a website.
      </p>
