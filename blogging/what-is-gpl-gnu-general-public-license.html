      <h1>What is GPL? (GNU General Public License)</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Date: <span class="post-meta">Nov 27, 2022</span></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>GPL</b> is a license used for software which makes them
        <b>license-free</b> or <b>copyleft</b> for general use. The first GPL
        was written by Richard Stallman in 1989 for his own GNU project. When
        this type of license is applied to the software it awards the users 4
        freedoms:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Freedom to <b>run the software</b>.</li>
        <li>Freedom to <b>study the software's code</b>.</li>
        <li>Freedom to <b>modify its code</b>.</li>
        <li>Freedom to <b>shares the modified software</b>.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Do you see where we are going with this, basically this type of licence
        does not restrict anyone on how the software is used. There is also a
        catch in this license, software which is currently under GPL if modified
        will also be under GPL.
      </p>
      <p>
        WordPress is a wildly used content management system under GPL. I can
        run the software as it is, can study the source code, modify the codes
        in the core files, and then share the modified version. Not just this I
        can even sell the modified version for a price. What I can not do is
        change the licence type my modified version will also be a GPL.
      </p>
      <p>
        I should also touch on the fact here that I can not sell the modified
        version under the <b>WordPress name</b> because that would be under
        <b>trademark</b> and <b>copyright</b> that does not fall inside GPL. We
        mostly encounter these licences when we install software on our system,
        it is in a form of a check box, agree or disagree button called the
        end-user license. It's a long document that tells us what we can and can
        not do with the software.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest example of a General Public License and a Proprietary
        License is <b>Linux</b> and <b>Windows</b>. Linux is open-source and
        Windows is copyrighted.
      </p>
      <h2>Importance of GPL and its effects</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        For the end-user, GPL is a beautiful thing but for third-party creators,
        it's a bit of a nightmare.
      </p>
      <p>
        End-user can have operating software, a web server, database software
        and a content management system under General Public License. This means
        a person can host a site and not pay a dime.
      </p>
      <p>WordPress hosted on a Linux system is a great example of this.</p>
      <p>
        WordPress and other CMS have these themes and plugins that one can use
        and they also come under GPL. This becomes a nightmare for the person
        who coded that theme and plugin. The creator is unable to protect the
        code and once it comes into the open it can be distributed further.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>How does evil take over?</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        There are these premium themes and plugins that are being sold on the
        market for a price, what if I tell you that the same theme or plugin is
        available at a 99% discount? Anyone will be thrilled but do you know
        what codes are running inside the software?
      </p>
      <p>
        This is also in the continuation to
        <a
          href="../technology/freeware-that-is-pure-evil.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >
          freeware that is evil</a
        >, there are these bad elements that take advantage of this GPL
        software. I wanted to take this topic because there is this trend that
        is taking place, where people are dumping GPL software on the web for a
        very small price or even free.
      </p>
      <p>
        As per
        <a
          href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >W3techs</a
        >
        WordPress has a market share of 64.1% and is used by 43% of global
        websites. Also, the easiest to install and run. This also means that
        there will be a ton of people who are not aware of the
        <b>code behind the software, theme or plugin</b>. This is where terrible
        things happen to good simple people.
      </p>
      <h2>How to be cautious?</h2>
      <p>
        My site is coded by me and I am 100% sure that there is no malware or
        ransomware in the codes. But when one buys or downloads these null
        themes and plugins and does not know about codes then the chances of
        getting hacked increase.
      </p>
      <p>
        To limit the risk always try to be the second person while going for GPL
        software. Try to take it from the creators. Firstly this will support
        the creator and secondly, you will get support from them directly. Yes,
        when one downloads a free or GPL version of a premium software the
        support from the creator is not available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's say the direct way is very expensive then you should be the third
        person and never fourth or fifth. Let me explain to you what I mean by
        fourth, there is a creator and I buy the software then I am second, I
        further distribute it to you then you are third, if you plan to give it
        to your friend then he is fourth in line.
      </p>
      <p>
        This trend that is happening as we speak where people are dumping a ton
        of WordPress themes and plugins is not correct <b>morally</b> and
        <b>technologically</b>. Plus the ones that are being dumped are not
        updated to the latest version. When software is not updated and
        supported they are venerable to attacks.
      </p>
      <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        GPL GNU General Public License is a boon to the software industry but
        end-users should know when it is an evil situation. For example, when
        you are looking for a WordPress theme buy directly from the creator or a
        legitimate source. Themes are used for a long time and regular changes
        also hamper SEO.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is ok to use GPL license software but if you can
        <b>support the creator</b>
        nothing like it. This ultimately helps the end-user in way of getting
        new and improved updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are still so many things that come under the GNU General Public
        Licenses, if you want to dive deeper into this license and gain more
        knowledge on the topic a good starting point will be the
