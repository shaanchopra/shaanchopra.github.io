      <h1>What are Nulled WordPress Themes and Plugins?</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Date: <span class="post-meta">Jan 07, 2023</span></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nulled themes and plugins are free copies of the premium paid version.
        Either a code is injected or removed from their core to make them stop
        asking for license keys. <b>Morally and technically incorrect</b> but
        legally valid. WordPress itself is licensed under GPL, allowing
        end-users to run, study, share, and modify the software. Unwantedly the
        themes and plugins have to follow suit.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you ever buy a premium theme or plugin you will find that they all
        are the same license. This is the reason why null themes and plugins are
        available. They are not cracked but modified so that do not behave in
        the same way originals do.
      </p>
      <h2>What is a GPL?</h2>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://shaanchopra.net/blogging/what-is-gpl-gnu-general-public-license.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >General Public License</a
        >
        is a type of license used to keep software free and Open-Source for
        general use.
      </p>
      <h2>Cracked vs Nulled</h2>
      <p>
        Cracking is a process where you have to modify the software which is not
        under the GPL. A very good example is copies of Microsoft Windows,
        Office and Adobe that are <b>pre-activated</b>. Plus you download them
        from some third-party website. This type of software poses a
        <b>serious threat</b>
        and should be avoided at any cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cracked software has the potential not only to infect your system but
        also to have legal implications if caught.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whereas nulled software is one which is modified because you are allowed
        in doing so under GPL. The only thing you should be aware of is not to
        <b>violate trademarks</b> like their logos and codes for selling the
        modified version.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nulled version if not procured from the trusted correct source can
        also be a disaster.
      </p>
      <h2>Is it legal to use Null WordPress Theme or Plugin</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, it is legal to use Null WordPress themes or plugins but please
        <i>do read</i> their licenses before you use it. Times there can be
        clubbed items such as fonts, images, or logos that do not fall under the
        GPL. When using a nulled version the original creator might not be ready
        to share those licenses with you.
      </p>
      <h2>How is it done?</h2>
      <p>
        In the installation files like the function.php, there are certain
        callbacks and hooks that keep on asking you to enter a key. You just
        need to edit them or add a line of code. All themes and plugins are
        built differently and modification happens differently. You seriously
        require a coder who would understand the logic that runs in the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are no longer called <b>untouched versions</b>. Yes, there are
        some premium plugins and themes that do not require modifications.
        Confused? Let's look at the process of what actually happens in the
        nulled world.
      </p>
      <h2>The Process and Nulled World</h2>
      <p>
        There are plenty of places where you can buy premium themes and plugins
        from the original creator. Let's assume that place is
        <a
          href="https://themeforest.net"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >ThemeForest</a
        >
        (one of my favourite places to buy premium themes and plugins), now the
        creator is the seller and I buy the theme. I am now the first party, I
        will then modify the files and pass them to you. You are now the second
        party the chain does not stop here you further give it to your friend's
        third party.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the modified version I, you or your friend anyone can start a
        website and start selling the nulled version. There is nothing wrong
        with it under the GPL license you can. There are plenty of sites doing
        exactly the same.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Then why do most blogs and creators say these nulled versions should be
        avoided?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here is the twist all of the GPL sites on the web state that they buy
        their version from the seller directly. They are the first party but
        there is no way to confirm that. Look at it this way Site A is selling a
        null version for $4.50 and a person buys it and starts Site B and puts
        it at $5. This goes on and on, no one knows where the original file came
        from.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you buy and use a nulled theme there is a <b>RISK</b> that you
        take. If you look at the GPL selling sites you will not be able to find
        out who is the seller or where he/she is from. If you don't understand
        the codes then anything can happen. If the nulled file is coming from a
        bad element then scripts can make your site venerable to hacks or
        attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will not get support from the original creator because there is no
        link between you and him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then what happens in the nulled world the original creators are also
        aware so in the core files, they leave time bombs which get executed
        after a certain time period.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center">
        <img
          style="width: 95%; max-width: 800px; height: auto"
          src="../images/time-bomb-in-null-themes.webp"
          alt="time-bomb-in-null-themes"
        />
      </div>
      <h2>Do nulled themes and plugins have an effect on SEO?</h2>
      <p>
        No, nulled themes will not affect SEO. Null themes have the same
        functions and same codes so there is no problem with the SEO. But on the
        other hand, if a time bomb gets executed or security venerability is
        found then that will affect your users.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the nulled theme, you should not be worried about SEO. You should
        be worried about the security of yourself and your users.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know what themes or plugins you are looking at but the risk will
        keep on getting higher if on your site users put in their personal
        details like usernames and passwords.
      </p>
      <h2>Reasons for using Null themes and plugins</h2>
      <p>
        I am personally unable to find reasons why would one use null themes or
        plugins. Cost can be a good reason, people who are running a very small
        budget would be looking for null themes. One theme cost about $59 and if
        you have 10 sites then that can cost you $590 that's high. That is where
        you start looking for a way out.
      </p>
      <h2>Where to buy Nulled themes and plugins</h2>
      <p>
        Any place where you can verify the first party and they will extend the
        support from the creator. You and your friend can pool in and buy so
        that you know that the file is not infected. You can also do a group
        buy, there are plenty of themes and plugins now available for use on
        multiple sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you can not verify the person or know if he is the first or not, then
        you should not buy or use that null version.
      </p>
      <h2>Reasons for not using a nulled version</h2>
      <p>
        The biggest is the support and timely update from the original creator.
        Updates are important as WordPress upgrades the theme and plugins all
        need to update. Another big advantage is newly added features that get
        implemented by the creator. If you are on the null version you will not
        get these.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sites when not updated to the latest version are then in the critical
        state. You would never know the update also has a security patch. Your
        site will be venerable to bad elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Support the creator</b> so that you can get further support and
        additional features for your site.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Always try to buy a clean original version of a theme or a plugin
        preferably from the original creator. Modifying the GPL version is not
        legally wrong but done by a bad element can lead you and your site into
        the danger zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Themes have an effect on SEO and should not be changed too often. So try
        to buy where you can get long-term support. You can even
        <a
          href="https://shaanchopra.net/technology/why-is-the-self-hosted-and-self-developed-site-so-important.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >self-develop</a
        >
        themes for your site. See creators put a lot of time and effort into
        creating software for you and when you support them you get things in
        return. Then some people will null their effort to make money themself
        is morally incorrect. Your going ahead and supporting that action is
        alarming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever you look for a null theme or plugin your first concern should
        be <b>safety and security</b>.
