      <h1>Why you should not use WordPress?</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Date: <span class="post-meta">Nov 28, 2023</span></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        WordPress (WP) is the most used content management system in the world.
        WP has a market share of about 67%. That is huge, I would say WP
        dominates the CMS world. The next best CMS is Shopify at 6% but I would
        argue that it is not a complete content system, it is more of an
        e-commerce space. Then is Wix at 3.8% but that is not an open source.
        The next open source CMS is Joomla which has a market share of 2.6%. So,
        if I had to remove WP, 67% of the websites in the world would stop
        working.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2019 there were 61.6% of WordPress sites were using outdated PHP,
        Even now there are about 5% of sites are yet to be updated. Will it be
        fair to assume that these people were not technical enough to know how
        to update? Here again,
        <a
          href="https://www.hostinger.in/tutorials/wordpress-vs-html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Hostinger</a
        >
        a hosting service provider clearly states;
      </p>
      <div style="background-color: #26272c">
        <p style="color: white">
          "WordPress is built on PHP and MySQL. Fortunately, you don't have to
          worry as you can use WordPress
          <i style="color: white">without any knowledge of PHP and MySQL</i>"
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        This is alarming because people are pushed to use something that they
        have no knowledge about. Convenience over knowledge. How many of these
        people actually know where their data is stored? I find it absurd when
        people write that you are in control of your data when using WordPress.
        I want to ask a simple question are you capable enough to extract your
        data from MySQL?
      </p>
      <p>
        In today's day and age, where you can learn HTML and CSS for free in a
        day, it will be disastrous to use WordPress. Here I will just put down
        my reasons why you should not use WordPress;
      </p>
      <h2>Complex to Run</h2>
      <p>
        Let's assume I want to run a WordPress website, I would require a web
        server along with MySQL and PHP. Let's not talk about the plugins and
        themes, let's keep it simple. Now, what do you need to run an HTML
        website? Just a web server. Then why make things so complex that you
        don't even know what it is doing? Plugins in WordPress are able to
        change the core code with a click of a button. Which you do not
        understand in the first place. There are about
        <a
          href="https://openhub.net/p/wordpress/analyses/latest/languages_summary"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >924178 lines for code in just WordPress</a
        >, you would add more when using plugins. If just have to host a page
        that says “Hello World!” I only need 10 lines of HTML code.
      </p>
      <h2>WordPress is Weak</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to security compared to HTML sites, WordPress is weak.
        With additional MySQL and PHP, hackers have more freedom to hack. If I
        host an HTML site and a WordPress site on the same server what will get
        hacked first? I have personally witnessed my WordPress site getting
        hacked but never seen an HTML getting affected. WordPress's biggest
        issue is having a database that is always vulnerable. Keeping data
        stored in a place where you don't understand how to secure it in the
        first place is alarming. On top of that according to
        <a
          href="https://sucuri.net/reports/2019-hacked-website-report/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Sucuri</a
        >
        94.23% of the sites hacked are WordPress. Also if have seen how WP is
        bombarded with SPAM comments and emails. That is just another way
        hackers are trying to find a weak point.
      </p>
      <h2>Set-Up/ Maintenance</h2>
      <p>
        It is not easy to set up and maintain a WP site. You have to
        continuously keep on updating the WP themes and plugins. It is not easy
        to migrate WordPress from one server to another. Consider this when I
        have to move I have to install plugins to do the backup and restore
        process. Yes, everything looks easy when you are using a cPanel, try to
        shift to a VPS from cPanel yourself. Then compare this to HTML sites's
        migration.
      </p>
      <h2>It is Not Free</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of people argue that WP is open-source and it is free. That is not
        true, the source code is free but you will still end up paying for your
        WordPress site. Here I am not talking about domain name and
        server/hosting. I am talking about endless plugins and themes. WordPress
        has an ecosystem that generates a good amount of business.
        <a
          href="https://shaanchopra.net/blogging/what-is-gpl-gnu-general-public-license.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >General Public License</a
        >
        that makes money, I personally have spent money on WordPress.
      </p>
      <h2>Third-party dependence</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to running a business website or a blog dependence on a
        third party is not a viable solution. It adds to the cost and increases
        the vulnerability of the code. WordPress is highly dependent on
        third-party codes. Your site is running at the mercy of someone else if
        they stop updating your site is poised to fail.
      </p>
      <h2>My Take on WordPress</h2>
      <p>
        WordPress is a great tool to get you started in your online journey. But
        it is equally important for you to understand the importance of learning
        and gaining knowledge. I have spoken about the importance of
        <a
          href="https://shaanchopra.net/technology/why-is-the-self-hosted-and-self-developed-site-so-important.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >self-developed and self-hosted</a
        >
        sites before. WordPress is all about convenience but if security and
        learning are at risk that should be avoided. There are many other
        content management systems out in the market where the backend is
        handled by industry experts limiting your site's vulnerability to hacks.
        Wix, Squarespace,
        <a
          href="https://shaanchopra.net/blogging/what-is-ghost-blogging-platform.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Ghost</a
        >
        are just some examples of paid CMS. There is always an HTML and
        <a
          href="https://shaanchopra.net/blogging/hugo-static-site-generator.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >HUGO</a
        >
        way that is free and secure. Yes, it will take time to learn and develop
        but the end result will be in your favour. You will not be dependent on
        third-party codes or applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can tell you this from my personal experience, I too have a WordPress
        blog, but it is also true that I learned to code and build this site
        from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>

          >HTML will always be the KING when it comes to website development.</b
