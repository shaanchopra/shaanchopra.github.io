      <h1>Securing WordPress Site</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Date: <span class="post-meta">Jan 09, 2023</span></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Securing your WordPress site should be on your mind from day one. The
        security of your user and yourself comes first. This should be taken
        very seriously, WordPress dominates the market with more than 60% share.
        That also means bad elements are working hard to exploit the domination.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are using Jetpack as a plugin you will also find the brute-force
        attack starts from the day you launch your site. How did they come to
        know? How do they do it? Is not my concern I just don't want to get
        hacked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before writing this I went on digging into what people were writing on
        their blogs about WordPress security. I found some of the posts really
        good but there are some that are asking you to write a bunch of codes.
        Now please if you don't know what you are doing then don't do it. Hire a
        person who can do this for you he or she is not going to charge you with
        a bomb. But at least you would know what is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every site will be installed differently, and have different plugins,
        different hosts, and different web servers. So, what works for one site
        that might not work for your site.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what works for every site is what I will tell you and you can do it
        without doing any technical work on your WordPress installation.
      </p>
      <h2>Good Strong Password</h2>
      <p>
        This is the first step in securing your site, this is also the first
        thing asked while installing a fresh WordPress. Weak passwords will be
        guessed or broken and this is exactly what brute force trying to do.
        Always keep a long good strong password for your site. You should also
        mix it up with numbers, alphabets and symbols.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the time the site gets hacked because of weak passwords, the bad
        elements are able to trace your name, date of birth, etc. With this
        knowledge, they are able to guess it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Never <b>underestimate a hacker</b> he knows a lot about you. That is
        because you lead him to this knowledge. If on your site you have links
        to your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or Linkedin account then everything
        is public. The hacker knows you well and if your password is going to be
        your “favorite-dish123” or your date of birth your site is going to be
        hacked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your password should be <b>unrelated</b> to everything that is not
        public. A good practice is also to keep changing your passwords. This
        can be done every month or week what ever you are comfortable with.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good strong password is the smallest and the easiest thing that one
        can do on their site. It's not very difficult to change it as well.
      </p>
      <h2>Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
      <p>
        Another essential tool is 2FA. Even if the hacker is able to guess or
        crack your password Two-Factor Authentication will not let him enter.
        There are a ton of plugins available to do this but I really like the
        ones that are free and not a promo to get a premium version.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use
        <a
          href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Two-Factor by Plugin Contributors</a
        >
        this is a standalone free plugin for 2FA. In this plugin, I also like
        the fact that there are other ways to authenticate if you lost your
        phone. You can use email, or backup codes if you lost your phone and it
        asks you at the login page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>If your site is old or new just go and install this plugin.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, if you want more and have some extra budget then there are other
        premium plugins that are available. They not only give 2FA but also run
        scans in the installations for vulnerability. These plugins are
        Wordfence Security and iThemes Security Pro and many more.
      </p>
      <h2>Always keep a Back-Up</h2>
      <p>
        One of my WordPress sites got hacked the hacker posted some posts and
        removed some post pictures adding his. I just deleted the whole site and
        restored it with the backup. Changed the password and deleted all the
        comments.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's all I did and it's been almost 5 years now no breach again. The
        one plugin I use for backing up is
        <a
          href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >UpdraftPlus</a
        >. Even if you are on the free version that is enough to keep your site
        backed up.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how big your site is always do a backup and keep it on
        rotation with a base untouched. This not only helps in securing the site
        but also when you are shifting from one host to another.
      </p>
      <h2>CloudFlare</h2>
      <p>
        Most attacks happen when your site is not secured. Use
        <a
          href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Cloudflare</a
        >
        and secure your site with the complete SSL. Cloudflare has some amazing
        tools that will make your site much more secure. It will even be helpful
        when your site gets hit by DDoS.
      </p>
      <p>Their free plan is enough to get you started securing your site.</p>
      <h2>Protect your Database from SPAM</h2>
      <p>
        Comments and forms are one place that is abused by a lot of bots. They
        not only post links but also codes that would hit your database.
        Regularly check comments if you have them activated. The two plugins
        that help in eliminating most of the SPAM are
        <a
          href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Akismet Anti-Spam</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-google-recaptcha/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Simple Google reCAPTCHA</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>Both plugins are free and great tools for handling bots.</p>
      <p>
        On this site as well as my other WordPress site I have removed the
        contact form plugins. Replaced it with a simple HTML code for filling in
        the details. When you press submit, now you have to send me an email
        your emails when want to contact me or use any of the social sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to do the same just select the HTML code in your contact
        page and add the below code:
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        <pre>
            <code>
&lt;div class="my-contact-form"&gt;  
    &lt;form action="mailto:YOUR@EMAILID.COM" method="post" enctype="text/plain"&gt;
        &lt;div class="my-contact-form-1"&gt;
            &lt;label class="my-contact-form-label-1"&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type="text" class="my-contact-form-control-1" name="yourName: " value="" placeholder="Your Name"&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="my-contact-form-1"&gt;
            &lt;label class="my-contact-form-label-1"&gt;Email address&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type="email" class="my-contact-form-control-1" name="yourEmail: " value="" placeholder="name@example.com"&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="my-contact-form-1"&gt;
            &lt;label class="my-contact-form-label-1"&gt;Comment:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;textarea class="my-contact-form-control-1" name="yourMsg: " value="" rows="5"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;button type="submit" class="btn" name=""&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;       
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            </code>
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>This form should look good so add this below styling in your CSS</p>
      <div class="code">
        <pre>
            <code>
    .my-contact-form {

        Now after this anyone who wants to contact you will have to send an
        email from their email. There will be no interaction between the form
        and your database.
      </p>
      <h2>Update Plugins and Themes</h2>
      <p>
        This becomes critical when you stop your site management. When WordPress
        rolls out an update the themes and plugins also roll out their version
        of updates.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Always keep your site application up-to-date.</li>
        <li>Remove all unused themes and plugins.</li>
        <li>
          Always buy themes and plugins from trusted sources and avoid the
          <a
            href="https://shaanchopra.net/blogging/what-are-nulled-wordpress-themes-and-plugins.html"

            rel="noreferrer noopener"
            >null versions.</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>Continuously monitor your site and user activity.</li>
        <li>Remove the SPAM comments and messages.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Security is very important and if you can just do the above you will be
        helping yourself in the long run. I do the above on all my sites as soon
        as I launch them. There should be no compromise when it comes to site
        security. Small things such as good strong passwords, F2A, and backing
        up go a long way.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are running a WordPress site then you must manage your site on
        regular basis. Logging in to your admin panel only when you want to post
        is not correct. Login into your dashboard on regular basis, and check if
        everything is working correctly. Do regular updates on themes and
        plugins. Monitor the comments, messages and other user interactions. All
        this helps you keep your site secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, if you are still looking to do more in securing your site a good
        place to start is WordPress
