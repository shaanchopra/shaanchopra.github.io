        Are you looking for a free SSL wildcard certificate? If you are then you
        will find everything you need here in this post. SSL are important not
        only for site security but also for SEO. On
        <i>August 07, 2014</i> Google
        <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >announced</a
        >
        that having a secure site will be a ranking signal. So, why not have an
        SSL on your site when it is free?
      </p>
      <p>
        SSL is a <b>Secure Sockets Layer</b> it makes your site go from HTTP to
        HTTPS, s stands for secure. It encrypts data communication to and from
        the web browser to the web server. In simple words when you type your
        username and password to login into any site. That request from your
        browser where you typed to the site's server is encrypted.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is very important, just think about it where all we type our username
        and password, banks, social networks, email accounts, and cloud drives.
        If these sites are not secure then your data can be compromised.
      </p>
      <h2>Type of Certificate</h2>
      <p>
        There are plenty of ways to get an SSL certificate but you should know
        what type of certificate you need. They all do the same job, the only
        difference is the <b>verification process</b>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Domain validation Level (DV)</b>: This certificate is for sites
            like mine, and blogs that are not on the business side. For these
            certificates, only domain ownership is authenticated.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Organisation validation Level (OV)</b>: This certificate is for
            sites that are in business. For these certificates domain and
            entities name and legal ownership, documents are also required.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Extended validation level (EV)</b>: These certificates are for
            sites that are organisations and are transacting on their domain. A
            good example is e-commerce sites. For these certificates domain,
            legal documentation along with the physical address of the business
            is required.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Then there are <b>Single, Wildcard and Multi-Domain</b> certificates. As
        the name suggests single are usually for one site or sub-domain. The
        wildcard is for the domain and all the sub-domains. Multi is for
        multiple domain names.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here on this site, we are going talk about Single, Wildcard, and
        Multi-domain authentication at the Domain level only. For the
        organisation and Extended you need to seek a certifying authority like
        <a
          href="https://www.comodo.com/business-security/digital-certificates/ssl-certificates.php"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Comodo</a
        >,
        <a
          href="https://www.digicert.com/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >DigiCert</a
        >
        or
        <a href="https://safessl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >SafeSSL</a
        >
        and many more. As there is insurance attached against the breach of
        communication data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the time for sites like mine, normal sites, and personal blogs a
        free SSL Wildcard at the Domain level is just perfect.
      </p>
      <h2>How to get a free wildcard SSL?</h2>
      <p>
        Everything is dependent on where your domain is and how you are hosted.
        There are a lot of
        <a
          href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/web-hosting-who-support-lets-encrypt/6920"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >hosting providers that support letsencrypt</a
        >. With these hosting providers, you don't have to do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then there is VPS, here you just need to use
        <a
          href="https://certbot.eff.org/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Certbot</a
        >
        that will take care of the SSL.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, there are shared and dedicated hosting providers that are not
        providing letsencrypt certificate. They actually want you to buy the
        certificates from them but they allow self-bought certificates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I start explaining to you how to get a free SSL are you
        comfortable with the SSH command line? In all cases, you have to run
        certain commands to get the certificates. If you are not technically up
        for it then there is only one solution.
      </p>
      <h3>Cloudflare</h3>
      <p>
        The easiest way to get a free wildcard certificate for your site.
        <a
          href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Cloudflare</a
        >
        is known and used by many sites for its security issues. They not only
        secure the connection from the browser to Cloudflare they also secure
        the connection from Cloudflare to your server. For this, to work you
        have to change your domain's NS to theirs and then use the DSN to point
        where you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this create an account on Cloudflare, it's free then add your domain
        name and Cloudflare will automatically pick up the DNS. Then provide you
        with their name server which you need to update in the domain name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have done that Cloudflare has now started a secure connection
        from the browser to Cloudflare. Now in your Cloudflare dashboard select
        SSL/TSL, you will find Your SSL/TLS encryption mode is Flexible change
        it to Full which is end-to-end encryption.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center; border: solid">
        <img
          style="width: 95%; max-width: 800px; height: auto"
          src="../images/cloudflare-add-dns-origin-server-full-encryption.webp"
          alt="cloudflare-add-dns-origin-server-full-encryption"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Now head over to Origin Server under SSL/TSL option and create a
        certificate. The keys that Cloudflare generates need to be pasted into
        your hosting account.
      </p>
      <h3>Certbot</h3>
      <p>
        If you have a ubuntu VPS, like on Linode, Digital Ocean, AWS or any
        other then you just follow the below commands and get an SSL.
      </p>
      <p>
        SSH into the command line and type the below commands and follow the
        instructions.
      </p>
      <p class="code">sudo apt install snapd</p>
      <p class="code">sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core</p>
      <p class="code">sudo snap install --classic certbot</p>
      <p class="code">sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot</p>
      <p>Lastly if you are on Apache then</p>
      <p class="code">sudo certbot --apache</p>
      <p>If on Nginx</p>
      <p class="code">sudo certbot --nginx</p>
      <p>
        After this follow the instructions of the certbot and you will have an
        SSL installed on your site in no time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any other OS you can always visit the certbot site and check
        for instructions.
      </p>
      <h3>Shared or cPanel Hosting</h3>
      <p>
        This is where things get interesting, a lot of people go for shared
        cPanel hosting because of the <b>cost and easy management</b>. Later end
        up paying for unnecessary add-ons. SSL certificates are one of that
        add-ons. You can still have a free SSL wildcard certificate when you run
        certbot on a different system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is what you have to do, <i>run certbot manually</i> and generate a
        certificate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting a VPS is easy you only need it for less than 10 minutes and
        still, if you don't want to spend any money then use
        <a
          href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Oracle cloud free forever</a
        >. They do require you to add a credit card while registering but they
        will not charge till you are in the free forever plan.
      </p>
      <p>SSH into the VPS and type the below command.</p>
      <p class="code">sudo apt-get install certbot</p>
      <p class="code">
        sudo certbot certonly --manual -d YourDomainName.com -d
        *.YourDomainName.com
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the certbot will ask you to verify the domain by adding a TxT record
        in the domain DNS and adding a file in the
        <i>YourDomainName.com/.well-known/acme-challenge</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once done correctly it will issue the certificate which is in the
        letsencrypt folder. You have to manually add the certificate in the
        cPanel's manage SSL. (Security > SSL/TLS > Manage SSL sites)
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center; border: solid">
        <img
          style="width: 95%; max-width: 800px; height: auto"
          src="../images/cpanel-install-an-ssl-website.webp"
          alt="cpanel-install-an-ssl-website"
        />
      </div>
      <p>To view the certificates type the blow command</p>
      <p class="code">
        sudo cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/YourDomainName.com/privkey.pem
      </p>
      <p class="code">
        sudo cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/YourDomainName.com/fullchain.pem
      </p>
      <p>Now you have a free SSL wildcard certificate on your site.</p>
      <h2>Drawbacks for free SSL by Letsencrypt</h2>
      <p>
        They are <b>valid only for 90 days</b> and you have to do the process again.
        This is more of an advantage because you have to visit your server's
        backend every 90 days and you have the option of updating everything.
        Which we most of the time don't do or forget.
      </p>
      <h2>Who should get an SSL certificate?</h2>
      <p>
        Anyone and everyone who have a website should have an SSL installed. No
        matter whether your site is a personal blog or a single about me page or
        business. If you have a website you should have an SSL. It not only
        protects your user it also protects your server from the wrong people.
      </p>
      <h2>My View on Free SSL</h2>
      <p>
        SSL is important, I have a site which is about 7 years old and I have
        never bought an SSL and always used letsencrypt. Always think of
        security for your user and yourself first. Always look at the padlock in
        the browser when visiting a site. Most browsers these days warn you but
        if you reach these then avoid submitting private data.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are these <b>third-part sites</b> that help you in generating SSL
        for free but you should also know that while doing so, your certificate
        is on their server. So please <b>be cautious</b> of these sites. If
        these
        <a
          href="https://shaanchopra.net/technology/freeware-that-is-pure-evil.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >free sites turn evil</a
        >
        you will be in trouble. I would suggest that you generate SSL on your
        own servers and not use any middlemen's sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you find any domain or hosting provider that is forcing you to buy
        SSL certificates from them only, stay away from these organisations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is going to be my last post for the year on this site. I wish
        everyone a very <b>Happy and Prosperous New Year</b>.
