      <h1>Why is the self-hosted and self-developed site so important</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Date: <span class="post-meta">Nov 19, 2022</span></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I must stress the fact that everyone should have a personal site. That
        site can be as small as a single page, just the about me page would be
        fine. In today's day and time, I can not think of any reason not to have
        a web presence. Let me tell you having yourself on social media
        platforms is not enough, you need a personal space that you control. In
        past, I have seen the rise and fall of social media sites and just
        social media even the top multi-corporations in this space.
        <br /><br />
        You must have heard that if a site is not charging you then you are the
        product. It is very true I am just data for these corporations. What
        happens to my data after 100 years, who would know? I just know one
        thing, I should know how to have myself on the internet and have full
        control over my data. I want to put my top reasons for having a
        self-hosted and self-developed site on the web.
      </p>

      <h2>Product Life Cycle</h2>
      <p>
        The things that bring your presence on the web are products, you can
        call them whatever but they have a life. Let us bring a few into the
        picture, FaceBook, Linkedin, YouTube, WordPress and many more. All of
        them are products and help us get our content across the web space. Now,
        behind these products are corporations that need to make money to keep
        going. If they don't have money they would take off the product from the
        shelf. I don't want to create content just to see it go down, I want my
        content to be there as long as I want it to be.
        <br /><br />
        From the birth of the internet till date the only thing that has not
        changed is a web site. Facebook is a website so is Linkedin and you are
        currently a page inside that site. I would like to be a website than a
        page inside someone else's site. I don't know when these corporations
        will pull the plug on these sites, I have no control over them and I
        wish not to be at their mercy. So, to have your own site which is
        self-hosted and self-developed is the right choice.
      </p>
      <h2>Full Control of Data</h2>
      <p>
        When I am self-hosted I have full control over my data, I know what goes
        across the web, what goes down and when it will go down. When you are
        not self-hosted you just have one thing in your control when to upload.
        Everything else is not in your hand, who sees what, where and when is
        controlled by others, this is on the social sites. Sites like FaceBook,
        YouTube, Twitter, and Medium have algorithms in place and their algo's
        would then decide when and where your data is shown.
        <br /><br />
        Let's say I upload a picture and then delete it, how can I be sure that
        the picture is completely erased from someone else's server? I have zero
        trust in the sites that don't charge you, I love free and open source
        but I have no trust in them. They make you check a box at the end of the
        registration, I have never read those terms and not because I am lazy
        but because I won't understand them. I know if I upload a picture and
        someone copies it and places it somewhere else I have no control over
        that. But at least I know there is nothing in the source location.
      </p>
      <h2>Room to Grow</h2>
      <p>
        When you are self-hosted you have room to grow and if you are on a
        self-developed site the growth can be accelerated even more. On a
        self-developed site, you know the codes and backend, you are no longer
        in an eco-system you are in the universe now. Just think about it people
        go all out on the self-hosted WordPress but they should also know that
        they are self-hosted but in a controlled eco-system. You can only be
        free when you are self-developed then the options are limitless. Yes,
        there will be small hiccups but you would be in full control.
        <br /><br />
        If tomorrow WordPress open-source comes out with a statement that we no
        longer will update or support the file, meaning we are closing down.
        When would all these sites go which are running on this platform? That
        is why it is always better to start something that you control and have
        room to grow.
      </p>
      <h2>Look Professional and Gain Trust</h2>
      <p>
        The most difficult thing to earn in this world is trust, forget about
        humans, Ai bots like Google don't even trust new and unprofessional
        sites. How do gain the trust of humans and bots by being self-hosted,
        having your own domain name, and having your individual IP address if
        you are self-hosted you are spending some amount trying to build a brand
        you are way more trustworthy than some free sub-domain brand.
        <br /><br />
        Now when you are self-developed you would always stand out from the
        crowd. That along with your own domain name would look way more
        professional. Just the email address makes you stand out. Having a mail
        address on your own domain seems very professional.
      </p>
      <h2>Gain Skill and Knowledge</h2>
      <p>
        Here is my story I have the .com version of the same domain hosted on
        shared hosting and on WordPress, I know nothing about the backend server
        configuration and WordPress code. According to the WP site health
        status, ” The optional module, imagick, is not installed, or has been
        disabled ”. I know I can just run a simple command “sudo apt install
        php-imagick” but for shared hosting, I have to contact my server
        administrator to do that. Look just by self-hosting on a VM I have
        gained knowledge on what is a server install and what is WP install.
        <br /><br />
        When I started this site I knew very little about HTML and had no skill
        in coding I am a business management person but I learned this language
        and added a small skill of web development. I learned something new and
        interesting. We all should spend some time learning a new skill which
        can be photography, painting, or playing an instrument. Just keep adding
        knowledge which is everything.
      </p>
      <h2>Customization to Core</h2>
      <p>
        I am self-hosted on a VM and this site's code is written by me, I know
        which code affects what function. The customization I can do is endless
        for this site. You can not match it with shared hosting or content
        management sites. I can change the code not worrying about the ecosystem
        and who is affected.
        <br /><br />
        I can stop the server, restart the machine, wipe every data in the
        memory and start fresh. Not to forget I can scale the resources. When
        you are on shared hosting that is a bit difficult you have to shift to a
        different plan and shared server.
      </p>
      <h2>Vulnerable to Hackers</h2>
      <p>
        How vulnerable is my site to hackers? Less than my shared hosting and
        WordPress site. The reason for that is there is no motive to hack. I
        have to database on my server this is an HTML and CSS based site. The
        only files on my server are the operating system, web server, HTML, CSS
        and images. OS and the web server are open sources and the rest of the
        files are public view. You don't need to hack into my system to copy
        them.
        <br /><br />
        For my other site, I have 4 connections and 4 passwords for the host,
        the cPanel, the WordPress and the last Database. If anyone is
        compromised I have an issue. In this site's case, there is just one of
        my virtual machines and that's it that I have an f2a enabled.
        <br /><br />
        That is correct everyone has backups if sites get hacked one can restore
        from the backup stored. That brings me to the question of where the hack
        came from. If the hack is in the code then the file you are restoring
        might have the same code. On a self-develop site, you wrote the code
        yourself so it is way easy to detect and remove the vulnerability when
        you code yourself.
      </p>
      <h2>My Closing Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        To be very honest it is a tough decision, I am very comfortable on the
        shared and WordPress site but I am also getting comfortable here on the
        VM. There are also other constraints that one should consider such as
        cost. Self-hosting with a domain name is not as cheap as shared hosting
        and non-self-hosting is free on WordPress, Blogger, Google Sites and
        more. I can only say one should have a web presence and full control
        over the data. One can always start with the free then gradually move on
        to self-hosted and then develop your own. I would suggest taking one
        step at a time and building your personal site and brand.
