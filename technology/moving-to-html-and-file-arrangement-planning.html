      <h1>Moving to HTML and file arrangement planning</h1>

      <p>
        Having a five or six-page static site is one thing and having a personal
        blog on HTML is totally different. My deepest respect for those who are
        still running their blogs on HTML. I moved this site thinking it would
        be easy and would be great to have one site with old school look and
        feel but when I am doing all the backend work I am now finding it is not
        easy. Even copying one code to another file doesn't work as it does.
        Moving a few files to the VM is very easy I use
        <a
          href="https://filezilla-project.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >FileZilla</a
        >
        to do that but the difficult part is the arrangement of files and
        folders. <br /><br />
        I thought I would just dump all the files in one location and images in
        one folder and here the site is ready. No that is not how it works now I
        find out, every folder adds up to the URL. For example, I am writing
        about HTML so this is a technology blog post. If I put this file in the
        folder named Post then my URL would be
        (https://shaanchopra.net/post/moving-to-html-and-file-arrangement-plan)
        if move this file to the folder named Technology then it will give out
        the correct location. So, I am ending up having multiple folders with
        different categories.
        <br /><br />
        Not to forget every folder will also be linked differently inside the
        blog and category page. To understand this one need to understand the
        hierarchy level of files and folders on the host. My root according to
        me is the folder name HTML all the files and folders go inside this
        directory. Inside this, I have my index.html, contact.html and all other
        pages that are not blog posts. Then there are the images, categories,
        assets and individual category folders so, while linking a file which is
        in the categories folder I need to use ../ at the beginning of the file
        that needs to be linked is in the individual category level folder.
        <br /><br />
        Exactly after the fifth file, everything becomes so jumbled. No wonder
        CMS like WordPress is so famous no one like to keep doing what is
        happening on this site. The only way one can survive is to be very clean
        in the code and keep a structure. Earlier I used to find comments on the
        backend of a web page and I use to think they are useless, now
        understand how important they are to the person who coded that web page.
        <br /><br />
        I am almost done with the basic structure of the site, after this, I
        will be looking to automate some of the functions and add some useful
        scripts.
