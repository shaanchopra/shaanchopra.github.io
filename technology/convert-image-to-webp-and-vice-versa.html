      <h1>Convert Image to WebP and Vice Versa</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Date: <span class="post-meta">Dec 11, 2022</span></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        WebP is an image format developed by Google and was announced in 2010
        but the first stable version came out in 2018. That is not very old but
        recently I see a lot of sites shifting from traditional formats of JPEG,
        PNG and GIF. The main benefits of the shift are the reduced data size
        without losing quality and reduced load time of the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days our cameras are capable of taking high-resolution pictures
        which also means the size of a picture is at least 5MB. If you put 10 of
        these images on the webpage then a total of 50MB of download will happen
        when you view them. The speed of opening these images will also depend
        on the bandwidth of your internet connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the load time of the page is more than 3 seconds then the user loses
        interest and leaves the site. That will have an impact on your SEO
        ranking and search engine do punish sites that have longer load times.
      </p>
      <p>
        To overcome this we resize and optimize the images. A large population
        uses JPEG and PNG but here you do lose on the quality. There is a better
        solution which is WebP which is lossless image compression.
      </p>
      <p>
        WebP is open-source and you can convert images to WebP or WebP to JPEG
        or WebP to PNG on your own computer without compromising your privacy by
        using online converter tools.
      </p>
      <h2>Download WebP repository</h2>
      <p>
        First, visit Google's
        <a
          href="https://storage.googleapis.com/downloads.webmproject.org/releases/webp/index.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >official WebP repository</a
        >
        and download the latest version, I am using windows so I will download
        the zip file <i>libwebp-1.2.4-windows-x64.zip</i>. I will unzip the
        content to my C drive. This folder contains all the required files and
        you don't need to install any of the applications. Its process is
        similar to how you install
        <a
          href="https://shaanchopra.net/blogging/hugo-static-site-generator.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >HUGO prebuilt binary</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h2>Add WebP repository to PATH</h2>
      <p>
        Open Advance System Settings, there are plenty of ways to do this below
        are 3 ways to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first way, One press the windows key and type Advance System
        Settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second way, open This PC in the File Explorer and right-click select
        properties and on the opened window on the left side you will see
        advance system settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third way, press the window key and select settings then
        System>About on the left-hand side under Related settings you will find
        Advance system settings.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center">
        <img
          style="width: 95%; max-width: 800px; height: auto"
          src="../images/setting-path-for-binary-part-1.webp"
          alt="setting-path-for-binary-part-1"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Once you are in the advance tab select Environment Variables, select
        Path and press Edit and add the path to the bin folder where the zip
        file is unzipped.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center">
        <img
          style="width: 95%; max-width: 800px; height: auto"
          src="../images/setting-path-for-binary-part-2-1.webp"
          alt="setting-path-for-binary-part-2-1"
        />
      </div>
      <p>Press Ok to confirm</p>
      <p>
        By doing this you are allowing the WebP binary to run without being in
        the same directory.
      </p>
      <h2>Check if the PATH is added correctly</h2>

      <p>
        Press (windows key + R) and type CMD this will open the command line
        type <b>cwebp -version</b> this should give out the version number that
        you have installed. If it does you have completed the installation
        correctly.
      </p>
      <h2>Convert Images to WebP</h2>
      <p>
        Now that you have done the installation you can convert the images to
        WebP by typing the command on the command line
      </p>
      <p class="code">cwebp -q 80 image.png -o image2.webp</p>
      <p>
        The structure of the above command is -q is quality 80 is the
        compression factor -o is used for naming the output file
      </p>
      <p class="code">cwebp [options] input_file -o output_file.webp</p>
      <p>
        There are a lot of [options] that you can do and for the complete list
        visit the
        <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >official WebP document</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h2>Convert Webp to PNG</h2>
      <p>The command for decompressing is below;</p>
      <p class="code">dwebp image2.webp -o image3.png</p>
      <p>
        In the above command, I am decompressing the image and -o is for giving
        the output name as image3.png.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is how easy it is to convert images from one format to other, if
        you have followed along you can do the same without compromising your
        privacy.
      </p>
      <h2>Advantages of WebP</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Reduction in size</b>: Save more space, I have personally seen a
        reduction of up to 30% with an 80 compression factor. You can do even
        more by increasing the level of compression.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Reduces site load time</b>: WebP compresses the images without losing
        on the quality and that results in better load time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Positive effect on SEO</b>: Better load time is a ranking factor so
        WebP will certainly add up to your ranking points.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Consistent image format</b>: Earlier we used jpg for normal images
        and png for transparent images now just use a single WebP format for
        both types.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>No compromise on the quality</b>: There is a difference between png
        and jpg quality but with WebP, there is no compromise.
      </p>

      <h2>Disadvantages of WebP</h2>
      <p>
        There are only two disadvantages that I have come across there might be
        more but I am sure these will be covered very soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Acceptance by browsers</b>: Not all browsers have accepted WebP as a
        valid image format. Mostly all the major browsers like Chrome, Firefox,
        Safari, Opera, and Edge do expect but some other small players are yet
        to follow suit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Social Meta Tag</b>: Twitter has accepted the WebP format but
        Facebook is yet to accept it as a valid format. So if you are on
        WordPress and using WebP format as your title image then when you share
        it on Facebook, the image will not appear. You can tweak this by loading
        a png or jpg for social cards.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        As much as I love open-source, I hate people who take advantage of a
        person who is not technically sound. WebP is open-source and yet I see
        sites that are ready to charge you for using their online tool. Why
        should I pay when I can do the same on my own computer?
      </p>
      <p>
        Then there is another issue of privacy what these online converters are
        doing with your personal images I don't know, they can scrap all the
        data or sell it, their wish. So, you are I are better off not sharing
        and doing it ourselves to keep our data and images safe with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly use WebP for image optimization, when I checked my site on
        Gtmetrix and Google Page Speed they always come up saying images can be
        optimized and this is how you do it.
