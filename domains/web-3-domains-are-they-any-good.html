      <h1>Web 3 Domains Are They Any Good?</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Date: <span class="post-meta">Jan 28, 2023</span></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        As I am getting active on the decentralised network, there is much talk
        about web 3 domain names. What are these web 3 domain names are they any
        good, let's find out. A year ago bought my first web .crypto domain name
        and recently added .nft, .wallet and .eth domains. For one whole year
        that .crypto domain was in my account doing nothing. I just put up a
        one-page site which gave me no information. The site would not resolve
        on any browser without an extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then <b>why are people going crazy about these domain names?</b> When
        technically these domains have a problem to resolve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only thing that is useful about these domains is a shortening of the
        crypto wallet address. More memorable I would say, but just for this
        reason buying 50 domains is crazy. What are you trying to build or are
        you trying to sell? There are a ton of YouTube videos that are telling
        about making money from selling these names. Here let me tell you that
        will not happen until you have a quality domain name.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same has been in the .com world bad names get registered and then
        drop like flies. Before you get into these domains I highly recommend
        doing
        <a
          href="https://shaanchopra.net/domains/check-before-buying-a-domain-name.html
        "
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >background research</a
        >
        on the web 2 domains how they work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blockchain as a technology is great but when things don't resolve for
        common users that is a big issue. Does blockchain technology make
        decentralised domain names valuable, no I don't think so. This is
        because If mass adoption has to happen then what is stopping .com and
        .net to move on to the chain network?
      </p>
      <p>
        XYZ has already started the chain integration then what makes these .eth
        and .crypto domains special?
      </p>
      <h2>What are these blockchain domains?</h2>
      <p>
        Consider them as normal TLDs but on parallel tracks. The irony of the
        situation is they came second so there is absolutely no support from the
        general population. You can consider them as non-fungible tokens (there
        can only be one and non-interchangeable) that can resolve into your
        crypto wallet address. You can also build a website but it can not be
        seen on a browser normally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blockchain domains are now able to do everything that a traditional .com
        or .net domain does but for interaction with these domains, you need
        special extensions. Now the blockchain domains are still evolving and
        more changes will take place. For that, we need to wait and watch how
        the whole blockchain ecosystem evolves.
      </p>
      <h2>Are blockchain domains truly decentralized?</h2>
      <p>
        The straightforward answer is no, I don't consider them decentralised.
        Ultimately you still need a location to manage these domains. For .eth
        it's
        <a href="https://ens.domains" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >ens.domains</a
        >
        and for .crypto it is
        <a
          href="https://unstoppabledomains.com"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >unstoppabledomains.com</a
        >. Without the managed service these are just plain NFTs with no
        domain-like feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just to understand this, currently, when you want to update the name
        server or add a DNS record you have to do it with your domain registrar
        (Godaddy or NameCheap). The same thing happens with these blockchain
        domain names.
      </p>
      <h2>What is the cost of these blockchain domains?</h2>
      <p>
        There are two types of cost structures that are in this space, one-time
        and $5 renewal. Ens.domains that offer you .eth names, there you will
        have to renew the names every year. The .crypto, .nft, .wallet and a few
        more are offered by unstoppabledomains.com is a one-time cost of
        $20-$100 depending on the name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't get excited with the one-time offer not all wallets are compatible
        with the services they offer. Just for example, the CoinBase wallet does
        not recognise .crypto domains as the wallet address, and neither does
        MetaMask.
      </p>
      <h2>Should you invest in these crypto domains?</h2>
      <p>
        To be honest, I would not go very far and invest in these domain names
        yet. They are still finding where they stand. I would currently consider
        registering what matters to me, like my first name, last name, or brand
        name. I have done just that, I have registered my first and last name in
        these blockchain domains.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to see a lot of trading before I step in as a domainer in
        these domain names. Because the primary purpose of these domain names is
        to add a human-readable address to your crypto wallet.
      </p>
      <h2>Who should buy these domains?</h2>
      <p>
        Usually, everyone has 2-3 crypto wallets, they are free. One for minting
        other for long holding one for coins that are normal. So, if you are
        active in the crypto world then you should get one. If you are regularly
        buying NFT you should get one. On the other hand, if you have no
        knowledge about the blockchain or crypto world they no reason for you to
        buy these domains.
      </p>
      <h2>Can you make money out of these NFT domains?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, you can but in this space, 99% are bound to fail. Have a look at
        the names that are available those names are not worth buying. If the
        legacy TLDs come on the blockchain then these names will be worth
        nothing. If I have a .com domain then I can just create a sub-domain and
        create that as my wallet address.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember these names are used as wallet addresses so if your name has
        zero, l (L) or I (i) so try not to confuse the person who wants to pay.
        You can make money but don't go overboard just yet.
      </p>
      <h2>My Take on the Web 3 Domains</h2>
      <p>
        Well it's a great initiative, but yet to consolidate. There are more
        networks in the making which means more extensions. With Solana also
        coming out with
        <a
          href="https://naming.bonfida.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >
          .sol</a
        >
        extension how many more are we yet to see? There needs to be one domain
        for all networks and different walled addresses. In my view, a single
        web 3 domain should listen and interact with multichain and
        multinetwork. Too many options make people and brands uneasy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will buy my personal domain and keep it safe but buying a lot of names
        for reselling that I don't see it happening yet. There are multiple
        domains on the ens that are yet to drop, the reason could be a cash
        crunch or forgotten/stolen wallets. See some domains in the wallet if
        stolen by some hacker is also a liability because it needs to be
        renewed. Well, the registration portals ask to renew them for multiple
        years, but I suggest not more than two years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I am watching the web 3 story but there is another story that is
        brewing on the handshake side. Why get into a sub-domain when you can
        own the whole extension? Yep, the handshake domains where you get to
        become registrar or the registry yourself. Strange but this is
        happening.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, I will like to watch where the web 3 space is going. There is
        still so much to learn as every day new innovation is happening. You
        never know when the consolidation start's to happen.
