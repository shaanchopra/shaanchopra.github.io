      <h1>Where to buy a domain name?</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Date: <span class="post-meta">Nov 21, 2023</span></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have an issue with how Google shows this wrong search result on the
        query “Where to buy a domain name”? It leads people to domain registrars
        to register a new domain. That is not a good practice when these
        registrars themself know most of the good names are taken. Most of the
        names that people want for their business are not available for hand
        register.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the domain names that people want to buy are already taken and
        listed on the secondary market. Yet these registrars want you to try
        your luck. After some difficulty, people end up with bad names or
        made-up words. Which is not bad but, why not start correctly in the
        first go?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>I know buying a good name is not easy but one should try atleast.</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are a few sites that one must check if you want a great name;</p>
      <h2>Afternic</h2>
      <p>
        This is a secondary marketplace by Godaddy and also the biggest. Most of
        the people (domainers) know about this and will list the names here.
        Domains are often listed as buy it now or make an offer. Not very
        difficult to operate on this site. Be assured your money is safe here as
        <a href="https://afternic.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Afternic</a
        >
        will facilitate the whole process. If the domain is not transferred to
        your account then money will be returned back to the same place it came
        from.
      </p>
      <h2>Godaddy Auctions</h2>
      <p>
        Very often domainers with good names try their luck in the auctions.
        <a
          href="https://auctions.godaddy.com"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Godaddy Auctions</a
        >
        is another location where you can get good names. There is also
        something as closeouts, to understand this you should know that we rent
        domains for price. Once the payment is stopped the domains expire,
        during this process names go through auctions if no one is interested
        they go to closeouts. Here one can straight away buy the name. This is
        somewhat before the name comes into the open market.
      </p>
      <h2>Dan</h2>
      <p>
        This is another marketplace now taken over by Godaddy. A lot of people
        list their domains on this platform. One of the best parts of this site
        is you can get in touch with the owner and work on an EMI plan for the
        domain name. Again
        <a href="https://dan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Dan</a
        >
        act as a facilitator when it comes to buying and transferring domain
        name.
      </p>
      <h2>Sedo</h2>
      <p>
        Here is another marketplace where a lot of domains are listed and one
        can buy or give an offer for a domain name.
        <a href="https://sedo.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Sedo</a
        >
        helps you all the way from payment to transfer of the name to your
        account.
      </p>
      <h2>Daaz</h2>
      <p>
        Daaz is another marketplace where you can get good names at a good
        price. Agan
        <a href="https://daaz.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Daaz</a
        >
        acts as a facilitator for the complete transaction.
      </p>
      <h2>Others</h2>
      <p>
        Now, there are many more of these sites where the names are listed, even
        some of the registrars like
        <a
          href="https://www.dynadot.com/market"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Dynadot</a
        >,
        <a
          href="https://www.namecheap.com/market/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Namecheap</a
        >, and
        <a
          href="https://porkbun.com/marketplace"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Porkbun</a
        >, have their own marketplaces. There are also sites like
        <a
          href="https://www.squadhelp.com"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Squadhelp</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="https://www.brandbucket.com/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Brandbucket</a
        >
        which one should take a look at.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also some big domainers that list the domains under their own
        sites, like
        <a
          href="https://www.hugedomains.com/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Hugedomains</a
        >,
        <a
          href="https://www.buydomains.com/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Buydomains</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="https://www.domainmarket.com/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Domainmarket</a
        >. I just listing a few of them but in reality, there are many more.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are planning to buy a specific name always check the who.is
        information and do browse on the name you might just see a landing page
        saying available for sale. Give it a try you will get a very high price
        but negotiation is another skill required while looking at a secondary
        market.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no specified rules of pricing in the aftermarket. The pricing
        is just on the basis of the current owner. Negotiate and buy that
        perfect name which will save you a lot of headaches in the longer run.
        These are just a few of the places one should
        <a
          href="https://shaanchopra.net/domains/check-before-buying-a-domain-name.html
      "
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >check before buying a domain name</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Having a good domain name is very important for a business and one
        should not compromise on this. Having a wrong name or a wrong TLD will
        just add to the problem. A good name will always add up to the success
        of the business.
