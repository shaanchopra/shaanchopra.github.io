      <h1>Check before buying a domain name</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Date: <span class="post-meta">Dec 17, 2022</span></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        A domain name is the most important factor when it comes to online
        presence. Domain names are now digital assets. A good single-letter name
        can cost you a couple of thousand dollars in the secondary market. There
        are certain good names that are still available in the market but it's
        important for you to check them before buying.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are only two ways to get a domain name either you register them
        yourself or acquire it from the existing owner also known as the
        secondary market.
      </p>
      <p>In both cases, you should give a deeper look at the domain name.</p>
      <p>
        Checking the domain before acquiring is important not only for
        <b>SEO</b> purposes but also for <b>Brand</b> identity and
        <b>Trust</b> factors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every day thousands of domain names are bought, developed and dropped
        for reason. It is impossible for us to know the reason but we can surely
        know what it was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am going to tell you everything you should be doing and what I do
        before buying a domain name. Before that, you need to have a clear
        understanding that every domain has a history of course leaving few
        untouched names. Here are a few steps that you can take and why it is
        important to do a thorough check of every domain you buy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sharing Matt Cutts's video, hoping it will also help in understanding
        how important it is to do a check before buying a domain name.

      <h2>#1 Check History</h2>
      <p>
        Every domain name has a history a good place to start finding out about
        the domain name is Google. Do a Google search with the TLD and without
        the TLD (TLD is the .com, .net, .xyz) and also use<span class="code">
          site:YourDomainName.com </span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you see sites that have mentioned the domain name then go on to
        <a href="https://archive.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Internet Archive</a
        >
        and do a search there, this will show you what your domain name was
        doing for the past few years.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is important because you don't want to get stuck with a domain name
        that was previously a spam site or a porn site or busy doing illegal
        activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me put it this way, I registered a new or bought an existing domain.
        My main goal for that domain name is phishing activity, so I develop
        that and do a couple of fraud transactions. Later when the domain
        renewal is due, I will not renew that name. That name will drop and will
        be available for the public to buy again.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don't want to be associated with such kind of domain name. Some
        people might say that it is a newly registered name and it's fine, but
        in reality, it does not work like that. The Internet is such a place,
        that domain has left a lot of breadcrumbs on the web. Which will be
        difficult for anyone to clean.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you see a bad history I would suggest looking for some other name,
        but sometimes it is important to get a matching name. I understand that
        every person has a different requirement in that case you can go ahead
        with other steps.
      </p>
      <h2>#2 Check Backlinks</h2>
      <p>
        Backlinks are important from the perspective of SEO but they also reveal
        a domain name's past baggage. A good place to start checking these is
        <a href="https://ahrefs.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Ahrefs</a
        >
        and Neil Patel's
        <a
          href="https://neilpatel.com/backlinks"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >backlink checker</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just to explain this I analyzed yesterday's two-word dropped domain list
        just the .com. There were 13594 total domains that were available, of
        which 2466 domains had 1 or more backlinks. Out of which 120 domains had
        more than 1k backlinks and 65 domains were getting referred by 100+
        other domains.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is <b>18%</b> of the <b>domains had backlinks</b>, and out of these
        <b>4%</b> had more than <b>1000 backlinks</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you see that there are just a few links then go on to those referring
        sites and see what they have written. If you see these sites giving bad
        reviews then that should raise an alarm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Backlinks to your site are one of the ranking factors in a search
        engine. There are two ways to deal with this situation. One is to
        contact the referring site's webmaster or the owner and ask them to
        remove the link. If the person is understanding he might remove it if he
        doesn't it is not in your control. The other is to disavow links in your
        own search console but this is just half done, the breadcrumb I was
        referring to still exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        The situation is such that you have a domain name and you have disavowed
        the link in your search console. Now if the user searches for reviews of
        your site he would land on the referring site where he will read the
        negative view. That is not a good user experience, you will be getting
        punished for someone else's doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, if you see a lot of backlinks you might want to hire an expert to
        do a <b>link audit</b> for you. When there are too many links then you
        want to dig deeper. You don't want backlinks from porn sites if you are
        thinking of an educational site that will be just terrible.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if you are thinking of starting a porn site yourself
        then it's good for you, it is just the
        <i>opposite side doesn't work</i>.
      </p>

      <h2>#3 Check Age, Authority and SPAM Score</h2>
      <p>
        When you register a new domain name the age is 0, but if you are buying
        a domain from the secondary market then checking the age, authority and
        spam scores are a must.
      </p>
      <p>All three are ranking factors on any search engine.</p>
      <p>
        For age, you can do a simple Whois search, for authority and spam you
        use Ahref or
        <a href="https://moz.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Moz</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h2>#4 Check Social Account Availability</h2>
      <p>
        If you have thought of a domain name and building a brand then you
        should also consider matching social accounts. Having matching social
        accounts does bring a positive user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having matching social accounts is a great way to engage with users on
        social media channels. A good place to start looking for social account
        availability is
        <a
          href="https://www.namecheckr.com"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >Namecheckr</a
        >
        or you can do it manually.
      </p>
      <p>
        While doing this you may find that an exact matching account is taken,
        if that account is unused you can request the current user to delete the
        account or sell it to you. If the current owner is not responding which
        happens most of the time, you can also contact the social media company
        if they can help you in acquiring it.
      </p>
      <p>This rarely happens but it's worth trying.</p>
      <h2>#5 Other Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        If you are just starting out then be <b>flexible</b> in choosing a
        domain name. Try to look for a <b>short memorable</b> name.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>TLDs don't matter</b>, if dot com is not available dot net will do,
        even dot xyz is ok.
      </p>
      <p>You can even go for <b>brandable</b> names.</p>
      <p>
        Having <b>numbers and dashes</b> is also fine it really doesn't matter
        in terms of SEO. Here do consider that your users should be able to
        remember the brand or your domain name. Try working backwards let's say
        Google is down and a person wants to connect to your site and you have
        numbers and dashes in your domain.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Yoursite365.com (memorable)</li>
        <li>Your-site.xyz (memorable)</li>
        <li>
          You-r-si-te-276-6743.com (not memorable, there is nothing wrong with
          this domain name it's just not <b>user-friendly</b>)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Lastly, <b>always look long-term</b> while choosing a domain name.</p>

      <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Buying a domain is very easy it just takes less than 10 minutes to buy
        one. It is really hard to build a brand in the digital space. It is so
        important that we should at least do some backend work while selecting a
        domain name.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not time-consuming or difficult to look at the history and
        authority score. Most people are just not aware of it. Domains are
        digital assets and before acquiring any assets we should do our
        research. I would suggest everyone check what you are buying or hire a
        domain specialist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later once you start generating content and start to market your brand
        it becomes more difficult to switch domain names. It is possible but
        then its time consuming and you would end up doubling the effort.
